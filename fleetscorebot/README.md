# Fleet Score Calculation helper

This script does a count of resinOS version / supervisor version combos for all the devices visible for the user running it (defined by the API key required).

Usage:

*   Create a `config/<ENVIRONMENT>.json` file where `ENVIRONMENT` is a name you choose, and points to an API endpoint and contains an API key for that endpoint
*   Run script with `NODE_ENV=<ENVIRONMENT> node index.js get` to get a list of resin OS version / supervisor version / count list
*   This script comes set up with shortcuts for the case when `<ENVIRONMENT>` is either `staging` or `production`, and can run the script with `npm start staging` or `npm start prod`, respectively.

The output is a tab-delimited table such as:
```
2.9.6   6.6.0   12
2.7.8   6.5.9   4
...
```
which can be imported e.g. into Google Sheets by copy-paste for further processing
